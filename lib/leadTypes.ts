/**
 * Lead types and constants, free of I/O.
 *
 * The same split lib/colleges.ts makes: lib/leads.ts is `server-only` and pulls
 * in firebase-admin, so anything a client component needs to *import as a
 * value* — the status list a filter renders, the source list a form validates
 * against — has to live somewhere it can reach. Types alone would be fine to
 * import from lib/leads (they erase), but `LEAD_STATUSES` is a real array and
 * importing it from there drags the Admin SDK into the browser bundle.
 *
 * lib/leads.ts re-exports all of this, so server code has one import as before.
